## Sekcja 1
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
max_rows<- 2000
```
```{r,results='hide'}
set.seed(100)
```
```{r read, cache=TRUE}
r<-read.csv2("all_summary.txt",nrows=max_rows)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(r)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
